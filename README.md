# Instructions
Build a 4 page portfolio site to showcase all of the projects that you've worked on so far in school. Feel free to include any other projects that you've built on your own time.

This project does not need to be fancy or highly technical as the focus is mainly on the process that you follow while working on it including breaking the project into logical parts that make sense when using version control and including a build process using NPM scripts.

# Submissions 
> Submit the GitHub URL for your project along with the URL for your hosted site.

# Initial Minimum requirements:
- All pages must include at least some basic styling.
- Include at least one feature that uses JavaScript. A few ideas:
 - a pop-out menu
 - an image slider
 - a modal view when clicking on images
- Include a projects page with screenshots of each project (including code!) and a brief description of the concepts and tools you used for each one. This projects page can be the home page of your website.
- Include an "About Me" page that includes information about you. Include a few images. What information you include is entirely up to you. Consider something about where you grew up, where you went to school, some of your hobbies, etc.
- Include a "Contact Me" page with a simple contact form.
- Include a "Blog" page with a couple of articles. You can use filler content for this for now (lorem ipsum). You will add to this page as a part of your communications class.

## NOTE: Additional requirements may be added prior to the due date for this project.
# Grading
Your grade on this project will be your final grade in this course. Prior to submission, be sure that your project meets the following criteria. This is exactly what your project will be graded against.

## NOTE: The code or the content you create will not be graded. Only the process that you follow while work on this project will be considered.

# Overall Project (10 Points)
Project meets all of the guidelines and completes all the initial tasks set out in the original project brief and the initial requirements listed above.

# Version Control (12 Points)
Repo is connected to GitHub, and has well-made and messaged commits with the proper files excluded. Although creating a minimum for the number of commits is not something that would be encouraged for production, there needs to be enough work to grade: You will need a minimum of 15 commits for full points on this section not including merge commits.

> Commits must make sense together and have proper commit messages.

# Automation (12 Points)
Project has a default build script that works from src to dist folders, concatenates and minifies CSS and JS folders, and optimizes images.

# Package Management (10 Points)
Project has a correctly formatted package.json and package-lock.json. node_modules are excluded from the repository. npm install correctly brings the project to a fully functioning state.

# Hosting & Deployment (6 Points)
The project is properly deployed and hosted on either GitHub Pages or Netlify (tip: Netlify allows you to use your npm build script to deploy your site automatically). The working build results from the latest automation build, and the user experience is identical to the developer's experience with local files.
