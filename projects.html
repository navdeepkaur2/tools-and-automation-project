            <p>The website named BR Architects was created for the final project using html and css at screen  widths of 1280px, 960px, 650px, and mobile with the help of media queries.</p>

            <p>A 2 player dice game, where two players take turns playing in rounds.</p>
            <p>On each turn, a player "rolls" the dice as many times as they wish. After each roll, the result gets added to their ROUND score. If the player rolls a 1 (on either dice), their ROUND score is reset to zero and the turn is over. After that, it's the next player's turn.</p>
            <p>At any time between dice rolls, the current player can choose to 'Hold', which means that their ROUND score gets added to their TOTAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn.</p>
            <p>The first player to reach 100 points on TOTAL score wins the game.</p>

            <h1 class="name">A BINGO game</h1>
            <img src="images/Screenshot3.png">
            <p>A BINGO game, where each player gets one or more BINGO cards. These cards feature five columns of five squares each, with every square containing a number (except the middle square, which is designated a "FREE" space). The columns are labeled "B" (numbers 1–15), "I" (numbers 16–30), "N" (numbers 31–45), "G" (numbers 46–60), and "O" (numbers 61–75).</p>
            <p>When a number is called out, players would typically "dab" or "cross-out" the corresponding number on their card until they, or someone else has successfully obtained a vertical, horizontal or diagonal line of 5 or more called numbers.</p>
                <p>The goal was to build a working BINGO card.</p>
                <p>A major use of addEventListener function made it easy to run the game</p>

            <h1 class="name">MITT Match</h1>
            <img src="images/Screenshot4.png">
            <p>Users should not be able to reveal more than 1 card at a time. If several cards are clicked in succession, only the first click should register and reveal a card.</p>
            <p>Users should not be able to open a card that is already *open* or *matched*.</p>
            <p>A card that does not match should automatically hide after a set timeout period.</p>
            <p>A user wins once all cards have successfully been *matched*.</p>
            <p>Upon winning the game, the user should be presented with an alert, indicating that they have won the game and how many moves it took them.</p>
             <p>A user can restart the game at any time by pressing the restart button. This will cause all the cards to be *hidden* again, cards to be reshuffled and the moves reset to 0.</p>
            <p>The game should display the current number of moves a user has made. A move is considered to have occurred when a card has been shown to the user</p>
            <p>By letting and storing the values,and then applying and executing functions with the help of loop(for),the game ran.</p>
